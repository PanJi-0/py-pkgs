    "Many Python packages include a command line interface (CLI) - that is, functionality you can access directly from the command line, without having to start up a Python session. The `cookiecutter` tool we've used throughout this book is one such example. CLIs can help users more effectivaly interact with your software, are often easier to use with virtual machines, and can make it easier to automate processes via scripting. Luckily, it's quite easy to configure Python packages to include a CLI, especially if you're using the `poetry` package manager tool. In this chapter, we'll walk through setting up a very simple Python Package that includes a CLI."

You can read more about this configuration in the [`poetry` documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#scripts). The `pypkgs` on the left of the equals sign is the alias you will use to access your CLI, e.g., we will be able to type at the CL `pypkgs <args>`.

    "The goal of this chapter is not to teach the syntax of `argparse` (which the [official `argparse` documenation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse) does an excellent job of already). Rather, here we wish to show how easy it is to incorporate a CLI into your Python package. We will leverage a simple CLI example from the [official `argparse` documenation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse) that takes in a list of numbers and provides either the sum or the max of those numbers based on the command given.\n",

    "import argparse\n",
    "\n",

    "    parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const',\n",
    "                        const=sum, default=max,\n",
    "                        help='sum the integers (default: find the max)')\n",

    "```\n",

    "In the code above, the first thing we are doing is importing the `argparse` module which we will use to help parse CL arguments. We then have our `main()` function, which is the function that will be called when we execute our package CLI with the alias `pypks`. The way `poetry` and Python CLIs currently work, we can't pass argument directly to this function, so instead, we define another function `parse_args()` to parse any CL arguments, and this is called within `main()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the `parse_args()` function, it contains a bunch of `argparse`-specific syntax for creating an object that can parse CL arguments. Briefly, the first line (`parser = ...`) sets up the parsing object which will hold all the information necessary to parse the command line into Python data types. We then add two passable arguments, the first is \"integers\", which must be of type `int` and can accept any arbitrary number of integers from the CL. The second argument is \"--sum\", this is an optional argument which returns the sum of the passed integers, otherwise the maximum of the passed integers is returned. In addition, all `argparse` object come with an optional help argument (specified with `-h` or `--help`), which will return a summary of all possible CL arguments and their help description (if provided). Check out the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse) for a more comprehensive walkthrough of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test out our brand new CL by re-installing our package and checking the help documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "pypkgs --help\n",
    "usage: pypkgs [-h] [--sum] N [N ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Process some integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "positional arguments:\n",
    "  N           an integer for the accumulator\n",
    "\n",
    "optional arguments:\n",
    "  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n",
    "  --sum       sum the integers (default: find the max)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to be working! Let's see if we can calculate the maximum and the sum of a set of integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pypkgs 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "5\n",
    "pypkgs --sum 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome! We've implemented a basic CLI here to show how this functionality can be accommodated in Python packages. You can check out a more complicated Python package CLI, called [`PyWebCat`](https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/PyWebCAT), that I wrote to interface with some open-source coastal video footage, following the above guidelines and structure. I also encourage you to take a look at the CLIs of any larger, open-source Python packages you use (like [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for example) to better understand how to write effective CLIs."
