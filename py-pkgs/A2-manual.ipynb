    "\"Installing\" a package (e.g., by `pip install XXX`) is really a two-step process: 1) building the package (in the case of an `sdist`), and 2) installing the package. Using wheels takes out the first step, meaning we only need to install. The install step is fairly simple, it essentially copies the decompressed package files to the chosen installation directory, the default of which varies by platform and by how you installed Python.\n",

    "In fact, we could manually install a package ourselves if we want to by decompressing a `wheel` and copying the files to their appropriate locations - there's no real reason to do this because it's far more effort than using a single one-liner at the command line, it does not resolve dependencies so could break your installation, and probably has other unwanted side-effects. However, it's a nice way to learn about the package installation process, so if you'd like to give it a go, you can try the following steps (which are based on using the MacOS and [`conda` package manager](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)):\n",
