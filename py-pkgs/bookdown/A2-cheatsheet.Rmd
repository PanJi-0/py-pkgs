Here we provide a cheat sheet guide for developing a Python package with the packaging tools discussed in this book, such as [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/), and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). This cheat sheet should be used as a reference for those that know what they're doing and just need a quick look-up resource. If you're a beginner Python packager, it is recommended that you start from the beginning of this book.

[**Download the cheat sheet from GitHub here.**](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/py-pkgs/blob/master/py-pkgs/images/raw/py_pkgs_cheatsheet.pdf)

>While this cheat sheet specifically relies on [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a Python package manager, builder, and publisher, the general packaging workflow shown is applicable to other packaging tools too.
