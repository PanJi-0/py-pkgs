A practical book on how to distribute Python code via Python packages - available online at <https://py-pkgs.org/>. This book is aimed at Python intermediate users who want to package up their code to share it with their collaborators (including their future selves) and the wider Python community. It's scope and intent is inspired by the [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book written by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

## Building the book

If you'd like develop and build the py-pkgs book from source, you should:

- Clone this repository and run
- Run `pip install requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
- (Recommended) Clean the existing `jupyter-book clean py-pkgs/` directory
- Run `jupyter-book build py-pkgs/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `py-pkgs/_build/html/`.

## Hosting the book (for developers)

The html version of the book in hosted on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. A [GitHub actions workflow](.github/workflows/render-and-deploy.yml) has been created for this repository which automatically builds and deploys the book on Push/PR to the master branch of the repository.
